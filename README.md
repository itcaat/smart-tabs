# Smart Tabs Chrome Extension

Smart Tabs is a Chrome extension that transforms your new tab page into a powerful dashboard for managing and navigating your open browser tabs. It automatically groups your tabs by domain, making it easy to find, switch, and close tabs, especially when you have many open at once.
